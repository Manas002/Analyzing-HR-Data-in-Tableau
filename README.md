# Analyzing-HR-Data-in-Tableau

In this Tableau case study, we will explore a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This course focuses on helping us import, analyze and visualize Human Resources data in Tableau. Building on our existing knowledge of the platform, we'll learn how to effectively work with Tableau using example data.

**Attrition or churn** is gradual workforce reduction through employee retirements, resignations, deaths or elimination of positions without immediately filling vacancies.

**Visualize What Impacts Attrition :**

We’ll carry out exploratory data analysis and will use calculated fields to help build powerful visualizations. We’ll finish our analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action it will need to take to retain more employees.
